COMPLETE DISEASE MANAGEMENT GUIDE FOR SUGARCANE

I. FUNGAL DISEASES

1. RED ROT (Colletotrichum falcatum)
Symptoms:
- Reddening of internal stem tissues
- Whitish patches with red margins inside stem
- Drying of leaves from margins
- Sour smell from affected stems

Identification:
- Split the cane lengthwise
- Look for red discoloration with white patches
- Check for crosswise bands in affected portion

Management:
- Grow resistant varieties: CO 0238, CO 94012, CoJ 88
- Use disease-free seed material
- Hot water treatment of setts (52°C for 30 minutes)
- Crop rotation with non-host crops
- Remove and burn affected plants
- Avoid waterlogging
- Balanced fertilization

2. SMUT (Sporisorium scitamineum)
Symptoms:
- Long whip-like structure emerges from shoot tip
- Black powdery spore mass covers the whip
- Affected shoots don't develop into canes

Identification:
- Characteristic whip structure (1-2 meters)
- Black spore covering (easily rubs off)
- Usually appears in 3-5 month old crop

Management:
- Plant resistant varieties
- Rogue out affected plants immediately before spores disperse
- Dip seed material in Carbendazim solution
- Avoid using seed from infected fields
- Maintain field sanitation

3. WILT (Fusarium sacchari / Ceratocystis paradoxa)
Symptoms:
- Yellowing of leaves
- Wilting during hot hours
- Bunching of leaves
- Internal reddening of stems
- Plant death in severe cases

Management:
- Use healthy seed material
- Treat setts with fungicide
- Improve soil drainage
- Crop rotation
- Remove and destroy affected plants
- Avoid injuries to roots during cultivation

4. RUST (Puccinia melanocephala)
Symptoms:
- Small elongated yellow spots on leaves
- Develop into brown pustules
- Severe infection causes leaf drying

Management:
- Grow resistant varieties
- Remove affected leaves in early stage
- Spray Mancozeb or Propiconazole
- Ensure proper spacing for air circulation
- Balanced nutrition

II. BACTERIAL DISEASES

1. BACTERIAL LEAF SCORCH (Xanthomonas albilineans)
Symptoms:
- White to yellowish stripes on leaves
- Leaf margins become necrotic
- Stunted growth

Management:
- Use healthy planting material
- Hot water treatment of setts
- Remove affected plants
- Avoid mechanical injuries
- Use resistant varieties

2. GUMMING DISEASE (Xanthomonas axonopodis)
Symptoms:
- Bacterial ooze from stem
- Yellowing of leaves
- Stunted growth

Management:
- Field sanitation
- Use disease-free seed
- Spray copper-based bactericides

III. VIRAL DISEASES

1. MOSAIC (Sugarcane Mosaic Virus)
Symptoms:
- Light and dark green mosaic pattern on leaves
- Stunted growth
- Reduced yield

Management:
- Use virus-free seed material
- Control aphid vectors
- Remove affected plants early
- Grow resistant varieties

2. YELLOW LEAF DISEASE (Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Virus)
Symptoms:
- Yellowing of midrib and leaf
- Necrosis in severe cases

Management:
- Use healthy seed material
- Control aphid vectors
- Tissue culture propagation

IV. NEMATODE PROBLEMS

1. ROOT KNOT NEMATODE
Symptoms:
- Galls on roots
- Stunted growth
- Yellowing

Management:
- Crop rotation with non-host
- Nematicide application
- Use resistant varieties
- Improve soil health

V. INTEGRATED DISEASE MANAGEMENT

Prevention Strategies:
1. Seed Selection and Treatment
   - Use certified disease-free seed
   - Hot water treatment (52°C, 30 min)
   - Fungicide treatment: Carbendazim @ 0.2%

2. Cultural Practices
   - Crop rotation (3-4 year cycle)
   - Maintain field hygiene
   - Proper spacing (90-100 cm)
   - Timely weeding
   - Balanced fertilization
   - Adequate drainage

3. Resistant Varieties
   - Choose location-specific resistant varieties
   - Rotate varieties every 5-7 years
   - Monitor new releases from research stations

4. Monitoring and Scouting
   - Regular field inspection
   - Early detection of symptoms
   - Immediate removal of diseased plants
   - Record keeping of disease incidence

5. Chemical Control (When Necessary)
   Fungicides:
   - Carbendazim 50% WP @ 0.2%
   - Mancozeb 75% WP @ 0.25%
   - Propiconazole 25% EC @ 0.1%
   
   Bactericides:
   - Copper Oxychloride @ 0.25%
   - Streptocycline @ 500 ppm

6. Biological Control
   - Trichoderma viride (seed treatment, soil application)
   - Pseudomonas fluorescens
   - VAM fungi for root health

VI. DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SCHEDULE

Monthly monitoring checklist:
Month 1-2: Watch for seed-borne diseases
Month 3-4: Scout for smut, early wilt symptoms
Month 5-7: Check for red rot, rust, pests
Month 8-10: Monitor maturity diseases, ratoon health
Month 11-12: Pre-harvest assessment

EMERGENCY RESPONSE:
- Suspected Red Rot: Immediate roguing, increase gap inspection
- Smut outbreak: Mass removal before spore dispersal
- Wilt patches: Improve drainage, apply biocontrol agents
- Rust epidemic: Emergency fungicide spray

Remember: Prevention is better than cure. Invest in quality seed material and follow good agricultural practices.
