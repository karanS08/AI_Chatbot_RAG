SUGARCANE CULTIVATION - COMPLETE GUIDE

1. LAND PREPARATION
- Deep ploughing to 40-45 cm depth
- Proper leveling for uniform water distribution
- Addition of organic manure (FYM 25-30 tonnes/hectare)
- Formation of ridges and furrows
- Soil testing for pH (6.5-7.5 optimal)

2. PLANTING
- Best time: February-March (spring), September-October (autumn)
- Seed rate: 35,000-40,000 three-budded setts per hectare
- Spacing: 90-100 cm row to row
- Depth: 7-10 cm
- Treatment of setts with fungicide and insecticide before planting

3. VARIETIES (India)
Popular varieties:
- CO 0238 (High sugar content, drought tolerant)
- CO 86032 (Early maturing, high yield)
- CoJ 88 (Red rot resistant)
- CO 94012 (Suitable for waterlogged areas)
- CO 0118 (Mid-late variety, high tillering)

4. IRRIGATION
- Critical stages: Germination, tillering, grand growth
- Avoid waterlogging
- Drip irrigation: 80-85% water saving
- Frequency: 7-10 days in summer, 12-15 days in winter

5. FERTILIZER APPLICATION
NPK requirements per hectare:
- Nitrogen: 150-200 kg
- Phosphorus: 60-80 kg
- Potassium: 60-80 kg

Split application:
- Basal dose: 25% N + 100% P + 50% K at planting
- 30 days: 25% N + 50% K
- 60 days: 25% N
- 90 days: 25% N

Micronutrients: Zinc, Iron as per soil test

6. WEED MANAGEMENT
- Critical period: First 90-120 days
- Pre-emergence herbicide: Atrazine @ 2 kg/ha
- Post-emergence: 2,4-D @ 2 kg/ha at 30-40 days
- Manual weeding: 2-3 times in first 90 days
- Mulching with trash

7. MAJOR PESTS
a) Early Shoot Borer (Chilo infuscatellus)
   - Attack: Germination to 3 months
   - Symptoms: Dead hearts, wilting of central shoot
   - Control: Seed treatment, resistant varieties, Chlorpyriphos

b) Top Borer (Scirpophaga excerptalis)
   - Attack: 3-6 months
   - Symptoms: Bunchy top appearance
   - Control: Remove affected shoots, spray insecticides

c) Pyrilla (Pyrilla perpusilla)
   - Sap-sucking pest
   - Control: Biological (Epiricania), chemical sprays

d) White Grubs
   - Attack roots
   - Control: Seed treatment, soil application of insecticide

8. MAJOR DISEASES
a) Red Rot (Colletotrichum falcatum)
   - Most serious disease
   - Symptoms: Reddening of internal tissues, white patches
   - Control: Resistant varieties, crop rotation, roguing

b) Smut (Sporisorium scitamineum)
   - Symptoms: Whip-like structure from shoot
   - Control: Resistant varieties, remove affected plants

c) Wilt (Fusarium sacchari)
   - Symptoms: Yellowing, wilting, drying
   - Control: Disease-free seed, soil treatment

d) Rust (Puccinia melanocephala)
   - Symptoms: Brown pustules on leaves
   - Control: Resistant varieties, fungicide spray

9. INTERCROPPING
Suitable crops in early stage:
- Potato, onion, garlic (winter)
- Groundnut, soybean, green gram (summer)
- Vegetables: cabbage, cauliflower, tomato
Benefits: Additional income, better land use, weed suppression

10. HARVESTING
- Duration: 10-12 months (plant crop), 11-12 months (ratoon)
- Maturity indicators:
  * Yellowish leaves
  * Dried leaf tips
  * Hard stem, metallic sound when tapped
  * Brix reading: 18-20°
- Method: Close to ground level cutting
- Cane should be crushed within 24 hours

11. RATOON MANAGEMENT
- Remove trash
- Gap filling with new setts
- Earthing up
- Apply fertilizer (20% higher than plant crop)
- Better irrigation management
- Profitable up to 3-4 ratoons

12. YIELD
- Plant crop: 80-100 tonnes/hectare
- Ratoon crop: 60-80 tonnes/hectare
- Sugar recovery: 10-12%

13. POST-HARVEST
- Immediate transport to mill
- Avoid delays to prevent sugar loss
- Quality parameters: Pol%, Purity%, CCS%

14. INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT
- Combine organic and inorganic sources
- Green manuring with Sesbania, Sunhemp
- Bio-fertilizers: Azospirillum, PSB
- Compost application

15. WATER MANAGEMENT
- Mulching with sugarcane trash
- Alternate furrow irrigation
- Drip irrigation with fertigation
- Avoid irrigation 20 days before harvest

16. CLIMATE AND SOIL REQUIREMENTS
- Temperature: 20-35°C
- Rainfall: 1000-1500 mm annually
- Soil: Deep, well-drained loamy soil
- pH: 6.5-7.5
- Avoid highly acidic or alkaline soils
