RATOON MANAGEMENT\n- Remove trash\n- Gap filling with new setts\n- Earthing up\n- Apply fertilizer (20% higher than plant crop)\n- Better irrigation management\n- Profitable up to 3-4 ratoons\n\n12. YIELD\n- Plant crop: 80-100 tonnes/hectare\n- Ratoon crop: 60-80 tonnes/hectare\n- Sugar recovery: 10-12%\n\n13. POST-HARVEST\n- Immediate transport to mill\n- Avoid delays to prevent sugar loss\n- Quality parameters: Pol%, Purity%, CCS%\n\n14. INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\n- Combine organic and inorganic sources\n- Green manuring with Sesbania, Sunhemp\n- Bio-fertilizers: Azospirillum, PSB\n- Compost application\n\n15. WATER MANAGEMENT\n- Mulching with sugarcane trash\n- Alternate furrow irrigation\n- Drip irrigation with fertigation\n- Avoid irrigation 20 days before harvest\n\n16. CLIMATE AND SOIL REQUIREMENTS\n- Temperature: 20-35°C\n- Rainfall: 1000-1500 mm annually\n- Soil: Deep, well-drained loamy soil\n- pH: 6.5-7.5\n- Avoid highly acidic or alkaline soils\n            ",
